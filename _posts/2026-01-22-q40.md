## Mitigations

This is a simple mitigation table for the PLD/SGE/NIN/MCH party composition. I made this before the common PF mit sheet came out from the pastebin.

## Clear Video

This was our clear video but recorded by my friend who was the 14th NIN to clear in total. We tried our best to prog it fast for the single digit NIN clear but we were too late. 

I am the PLD in this video.
