This is my website to archive all the random stuff I made for the game FF14. I started raiding during the AAC LHW tier in the Dawntrail expansion and I have not stopped since (yet). I just like making all sorts of random things and I don't have a place to share it so I made a website for it. Feel free to use this website as a reference.

## Raiding Experience
I like raiding on my own pace and I mainly focus on getting the clear/achievement. I can flex on multiple roles but I stick to support if possible.

### Savage
- Dawntrail: AAC LHW (PLD), AAC CW (PCT), AAC HW (MNK)

### Ultimates
- The Unending Coil of Bahamut (PCT/AST)
- The Weapon's Refrain (AST)
- Futures Rewritten (BRD)

### Others
- Cloud of Darkness Chaotic
- Another Sil'dihn Subterrane Savage (PLD)
- The Forked Tower: Blood (Infamy of Blood)
- Q40 (PLD)
